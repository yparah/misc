# Car tuning explained

When it comes to [car tuning](https://carmods.ru), most people think of things like changing the exhaust note, increasing the power, or adding a performance enhancement kit (P.E.K). While these are all common modifications, tuning can also involve changing the car’s engine calibration, or the way the car responds to commands from the driver.

When tuning a car, it’s important to find out what the car’s limitations are. Once you know those, you can start to work on improving them. For example, if the car’s engine is limited by the size of its fuel injection system, you may need to upgrade the system in order to increase performance.

Similarly, if the car’s suspension is causing it to perform poorly, you may want to consider upgrading the suspension system. By doing so, you can improve the car’s handling and overall performance.

## Car tuning types

There are a few different types of car tuning that you might want to consider.

Engine calibration tuning is the simplest type of tuning. This involves changing the settings on the engine so that it responds more accurately to commands from the driver.

Performance enhancement tuning is a bit more complicated. This type of tuning focuses on improving the performance of the car in specific areas, such as increasing power or improving fuel efficiency.

Suspension tuning is also a type of performance enhancement tuning. This involves adjusting the car’s suspension to improve its handling.

## Car tuning tips

When tuning a car, it’s important to keep the following tips in mind:

1. Start with the basics. Before you start modifying any of the car’s components, it’s important to first test the car to see how it performs under normal conditions. This will help you know what changes you need to make to the car’s performance without having to risk damaging it.

2. Pay attention to the car’s limits. Once you know the limits of the car, you can start to work on improving them. For example, if the car’s engine is limited by the size of its fuel injection system, you may need to upgrade the system in order to increase performance.

3. Be patient. It can take a bit of time to tune a car correctly. However, the payoff can be worth it – especially if you’re looking to improve the car’s performance in a specific area.

4. Be prepared to invest time and money. Tuning a car can be an expensive proposition, so be prepared to invest time and money in order to get the most out of it.

## Does tuning car void warranty

There is no clear answer to this question. Some car manufacturers may have a warranty that does not cover tuning, while others may not.

## Is tuning your car legal

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the legality of tuning your car will vary depending on the state in which you live and the type of tuning you are doing. In general, though, most tuning is generally legal as long as you are following the relevant state laws.

## How much does car tuning cost?

Cost of car tuning will vary depending on the level of customization and services required. However, some basic car tuning services can typically cost between $50 and $300, and more complex adjustments or modifications may cost considerably more.
